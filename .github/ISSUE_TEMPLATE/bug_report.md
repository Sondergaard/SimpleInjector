## Write a great title
Write a title that summarizes the specific problem, question, or feature request. Your title should be specific. If you have trouble coming up with a title, consider writing the title last. Here are some examples of good and bad titles:

Bad titles:
* Simple Injector Confusion
* How to get container instance
* sitecore upgrade issue with Simple Injector

Good titles:
* How to prevent Simple Injector from resolving generated ASP.NET Core TagHelper classes?
* Singletons are caching ThreadAbortExceptions, requiring the application to be restarted
* Can the ASP.NET Core integration cross-wiring feature work the other way around?

## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

## Actual behavior
A clear and concise description. Additionally, a complete stack trace including all exception details of the exception and all inner exceptions if an exception is thrown.

## To Reproduce
Please provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example that reproduces the problem. (see: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) 

## Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here. e.g.:
* Library versions (version of Simple Injector and all affected integration packages)
* .NET version
* Used libraries or frameworks (with version) that are required

## Important
* Do *not* include screen shots of code or exceptions. (see: https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofcode and https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofanexception/)
* Do ensure that code listing don't have a line width that exceeds 100 characters, as that would cause horizontal scrollbars, which make it harder to view the code.
* Follow the guidelines given by Stack Overflow and https://idownvotedbecau.se/.
